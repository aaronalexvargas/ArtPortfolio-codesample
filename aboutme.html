			<p><h3>My Story</h3>
			My name is Danya Gayle. I am from Jacksonville, Florida. However, my family is from Jamaica.  
			I love to travel. I moved to Chicago this past Fall (2013) to further pursue my academics.  
			Currently, I am studying Biomedical Visualization (BVIS) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). 
			So far, my experience in Chicago has been absolutely delightful.
			</p>
			<p><h3>Background</h3>
			I was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2012, I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree concentrating in Painting/Drawing with a minor in Biology. My educational experiences include neuroscience, anatomy and physiology, organic chemistry, medical terminology, molecular and cellular biology, internship in visual arts, printmaking, basic computer images, digital photography for designers, 3-dimensional design, figurative sculpting, figure painting, and figure drawing. As a home-schooled student at age 16, I volunteered using my knowledge of art and biology. These experiences included assisting the museum educator at The Museum of Modern Art in Jacksonville, Florida, teaching art activities.
			</p>
			<p>I also facilitated a physical therapist with hippo-therapy and therapeutic riding for the disabled children, and volunteered at local hospitals transporting medical records, specimens, flowers to the rooms, and art therapy with the patients. Recently, I interned with Art With a Heart doing art therapy and photography with the children at Wolfson’s Children’s Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
			<p>In addition, I interned at Legal Artworks, Jacksonville, Florida. Among other duties, I held the responsibility of investigating different surgical methods for the Illustrators used in litigation for high profile trial attorneys and medical publications.  My efforts also resulted in a more efficient company database.  I helped bring into fruition various direct mail campaigns in conjunction with being an important player in the initiation of their newly acquired company Qualis Media.</p>
			<p>After graduating from The University of North Florida, I furthered my studies in art by studying abroad in Turkey, Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy. </p>
			<p><h3>Aspirations</h3>
			Ultimately, I plan to complete my graduate studies and obtain a Master of Medical Illustration.</p>
